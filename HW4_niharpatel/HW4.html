                The panda is one of the most loved animals in the world. It has a soft, round body covered in black and white fur that makes it look very cute. Pandas spend most of their time eating bamboo in peaceful mountain forests. They are gentle and calm animals that move slowly and enjoy climbing trees. Even though they are large, pandas are playful and curious. Sadly, they are endangered, so protecting their natural home is very important.</p>
