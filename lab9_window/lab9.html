It is the largest member of the cat family and is admired for its strength and grace. Tigers are skilled hunters that usually live alone and hunt at night, feeding on deer, wild boar, and other animals. They are found mainly in forests and grasslands across Asia. Despite their beauty and importance in nature, tigers are an endangered species due to hunting and habitat loss. Protecting tigers is important to maintain the balance of our ecosystem and preserve wildlife for future generations.</p>
